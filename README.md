# Badgersaur

This ambitious project began with an idea, a dream. That one day, I could put my copious amount of jank cards into a database and have it spit out a decklist that looks reasonable. Today, if you are reading this, that dream has just become a reality. Feed the badgersaur your jank cards and, by god, we'll see if we can make a deck from it.

## Goals:
- I want to enter a list of my cards
- I want the program to scan for decks with the highest matching amount of cards
- I want the program to present a list to the user of the decks that the program found
- I want to link the original decks to the user

maybe features?
present a text-list of each deck for comparison
    - highlights the difference between the decks

## Installation
